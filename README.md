# FloodFill
Implemented the Flood Fill algorithm using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is  a web-based application that allows users to interactively apply the Flood Fill algorithm on a the given grid.

4)Now the starting cell, plus any cell connected 4-directionally to the starting cell of the same colour as the starting cell, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those cell (also with the same colour as the starting cell), and so on ... is replaced with the newColor.
